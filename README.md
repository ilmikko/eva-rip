Diving deep into the android system

Hello, and welcome to the repository that I use to fix my phone.
You can find the blog where I'll tell about it a bit more detailed over on https://5x.fi/eva-rip/.

## Installation and setup

In order to run this, you need to install adb and fastboot on your computer. You will also need the basic GNU toolset for compiling cpio archives and gzipping stuff.
